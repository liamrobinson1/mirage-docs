Getting Started
===============

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create a virtual environment to hold the ``pyspaceaware`` installation
* Create a personal access token on GitHub, described `here <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-token>`_.
* Make sure it has access to read (and/or write) to repositories
* Pull the new package updates into your old environment with

::
  
  pip install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/liamrobinson1/pyspaceaware.git --upgrade

Where you set ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` as an environmental variable equal to the token created earlier. Alternatively, you can just plug the token directly into the pip install, it'll just look ugly. Let me know if you encounter any weirdness.
