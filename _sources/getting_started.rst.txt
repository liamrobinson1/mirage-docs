Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure you have installed a Python version equal or greater than 3.9, preferably 3.11.
* Create a virtual environment in the current directory to hold the ``MIRAGE`` installation

.. prompt:: bash

  python -m venv
  source bin/activate

* Create a personal access token on GitHub, described `by this article <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-token>`_, make sure the token has access to read permissions to your repositories
* Install the ``MIRAGE`` package into your environment with

.. prompt:: bash

  pip install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/ljrobins/mirage.git --upgrade

Where you set ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` as an environmental variable equal to the token created earlier. Alternatively, you can just plug the token directly into the pip install like so:

.. prompt:: bash

  pip install git+https://MY_TOKEN_VALUE@github.com/ljrobins/mirage.git --upgrade


Let me know if you encounter any issues.
