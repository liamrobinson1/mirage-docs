CCD Heuristics
==============

Examples to develop a better intuition for CCD counts from known sources

    For a telescope pointed towards zenith of 22 MPSAS sky, each pixel counts on average 1.53 per second

We can also look at counts due to point sources. Note that these sources are actually spread across a few pixels, so the values are actually much lower on the CCD

    total_star_counts = sint_val * mr.apparent_magnitude_to_irradiance(16)
    print(f'A magnitude 16 star produces on average {total_star_counts:.2e} counts per second')

    total_star_counts = sint_val * mr.apparent_magnitude_to_irradiance(8)
    print(f'A magnitude 8 star produces on average {total_star_counts:.2e} counts per second')

    A magnitude 16 star produces on average 7.30e+02 counts per second
    A magnitude 8 star produces on average 1.16e+06 counts per second
